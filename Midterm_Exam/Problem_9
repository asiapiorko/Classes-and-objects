# Write a function to flatten a list. The list contains other lists, strings, or ints. For example, [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5]
# is flattened into [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5] (order matters).

# def flatten(aList):
#    ''' 
#    aList: a list 
#    Returns a copy of aList, which is a flattened version of aList 
#    '''




def flatten(aList):
    new_list = []
    
    for value in aList:
        if value is not list:
            new_list.append(value)
        else: 
            new_list.extend(flatten(item)) 
    return new_list
