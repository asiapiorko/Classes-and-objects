Changing class attributes

You learned how to define class attributes and how to access them from class instances. 
So what will happen if you try to assign another value to a class attribute when accessing it from an instance? The answer is not as simple as you might think!

The Player class from the previous exercise is pre-defined. Recall that it has a position instance attribute, and MAX_SPEED and MAX_POSITION class attributes. 
The initial value of MAX_SPEED is 3.

--------------------------------------------------------

Create two Player objects p1 and p2.
Print p1.MAX_SPEED and p2.MAX_SPEED.
Assign 7 to p1.MAX_SPEED.
Print p1.MAX_SPEED and p2.MAX_SPEED again.
Print Player.MAX_SPEED.
Examine the output carefully.

--------------------------------------------------------

# Create Players p1 and p2
p1 = Player()
p2 = Player()

print("MAX_SPEED of p1 and p2 before assignment:")
# Print p1.MAX_SPEED and p2.MAX_SPEED
print(p1.MAX_SPEED)
print(p2.MAX_SPEED)

# Assign 7 to p1.MAX_SPEED
p1.MAX_SPEED = 7

print("MAX_SPEED of p1 and p2 after assignment:")


# Print p1.MAX_SPEED and p2.MAX_SPEED
print(p1.MAX_SPEED)
print(p2.MAX_SPEED)

print("MAX_SPEED of Player:")
# Print Player.MAX_SPEED
print(Player.MAX_SPEED)
