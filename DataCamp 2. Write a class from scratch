"""
You are a Python developer writing a visualization package. For any element in a visualization, you want to be able to tell the position of the element, how far it is from other elements, and easily implement horizontal or vertical flip .

The most basic element of any visualization is a single point. In this exercise, you'll write a class for a point on a plane from scratch.

# Write the class Point as outlined in the instructions
from math import sqrt

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = 0.0, y = 0.0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def distance_to_origin(self):
        return(sqrt(self.x**2 + self.y**2))
    
    def reflect(self, axis):
        if axis == "x":
            self.y = -self.y
        elif axis == "y":
            self.x = -self.x
        else:
            print("Error message")

pt = Point(x=3.0)
pt.reflect("y")
print((pt.x, pt.y))
pt.y = 4.0
print(pt.distance_to_origin())
